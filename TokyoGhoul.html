    <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
    <p id="intro">
        Ken Kaneki (金カネ木キ 研ケン, Kaneki Ken) is the main protagonist of the Tokyo Ghoul series. He is currently Touka Kirishima's husband, 
        and the father of Ichika Kaneki. Previously, he was a student who studied Japanese literature at Kamii University, living a relatively normal life. 
        However, this quickly changed after Rize Kamishiro's kakuhou was transplanted into him and transformed him into a one-eyed ghoul. 
        Kaneki is the first known artificial one-eyed ghoul. His unique half ghoul state is what later inspires the idea of the Quinx. 
        After joining Anteiku as a part-time waiter, he learns how to live as a ghoul and eventually becomes known as Eyepatch (眼帯, Gantai).
        After being captured by Aogiri Tree, he underwent a drastic personality change and after escaping, formed a group with the goal of protecting 
        those precious to him and exterminating individuals threatening his place of belonging. His kakuja form's distinct appearance earned him the alias Centipede (ムカデ, Mukade).
        Two years following his defeat against Kishou Arima, he lived under the identity of Haise Sasaki (佐々木ササキ 琲ハイ世セ, Sasaki Haise), 
        a Rank 1 Ghoul Investigator who served as the mentor of the CCG's Quinx Squad. His memories were initially lost to him, but regained during the Tsukiyama Family Extermination Operation. 
        Six months after the operation, ghouls came to know him by the moniker of the Black Reaper.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
        As a child, Kaneki had all the same features he has now as an adult with black hair. As a normal university student, 
        Kaneki was a somewhat short and scrawny young man with little to no athletic background and preferred to read books. After the steel beam incident, 
        Kaneki bears a scar from the transplant operation on the right side of his abdomen not far from his navel.[15][16] In his free time, he wore casual clothes.
        His casual outfit consists of a turquoise hoodie, light black pants, running shoes with a yellow toe and blue outlines reaching the middle of the black base of the soles.
        At work, he wore the standard Anteiku waiter uniform, consisting of black trousers and a gray waistcoat over a white dress shirt and a black necktie (brown cravat in the anime). 
        Because he could not yet properly control his single kakugan that manifests in his left eye, he wore a medical eye patch to cover it.
        His ghoul mask resembles a leather gimp mask with an eye patch. It bears a lipless mouth with large, gnashing teeth, much like a restrained asylum monster. 
        The bolts sticking out of his neck and the fact that he is an artificial ghoul invoke a Frankenstein-like theme.
        After being tortured by Yamori, his appearance changed drastically. His hair became completely white, his nails were blackened, and he developed a more muscular physique. 
        He began to favor monochrome clothing and wore a form-fitting black bodysuit with cutouts when going into battle. His attitude changed as well. 
        He became more cold, and left his innocence behind as he fully embraced his inner ghoul.
        In the years since adopting the identity of Haise Sasaki, his hair began to develop black streaks growing out from the crown. He wore the standard business attire of a ghoul investigator, 
        favouring black dress shirts and pinstripe pants with a knee-length white trench coat. He also wears a pair of round eyeglasses when reading. 
        After the events of the Auction Mopping-up Operation, his hair slowly began to revert back to its original color with almost no white remaining.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
        Upon regaining his identity as Ken Kaneki, his hair turned completely white again after having his limbs cut off repeatedly by Arima. 
        Unable to heal properly from the incident, both of his arms are covered in reptile-like scales. As a result he continues to wear gloves to cover them with black turtleneck shirts with a pair of white pants. 
        Around his neck, he keeps Touka's parents' ring on a chain, and after their marriage, the scar from her bite mark on his right shoulder. For a time, 
        Kaneki wore a collared black coat over his new sleeveless battle suit with dark gloves reaching past his elbows.
        After becoming immobilized inside Dragon, Kaneki took on the form of a beast big enough to wrap around skyscrapers, with many huge kakugan protruding from large, black limbs. 
        Kaneki was uncontrollable in this state and kept expanding. He had already completely destroyed a large sector of the 23rd ward and presumably completely collapsed the 24th ward.
        Upon being recovered from dragon by Touka Kirishima and the Q's squad, Kaneki lost much of his muscular mass, and is confirmed to have gained new unidentified organs after his transformation. 
        His entire body from the neck down was covered in kagune-like tissue, along with several black growths running down the front of his upper torso, and his hands possessed three misshapen fingers. 
        His hair was lengthier and hung down below the chin. There appeared to be flesh patterns decorating his neck and lower eyelids. However, upon releasing his new kagune, 
        his body appears to have returned to normal, with his hands once again possessing five fingers and being without the previous scales.
