    <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
    <p id="intro">
        Eren Yeager is introduced as a ten-year-old residing in the town of Shiganshina who dreams of joining the Survey Corps in order to explore the outside world beyond the walls. 
        A year prior to the events of the story, accompanying his father Grisha to meet her parents, Eren saves Mikasa Ackerman from a group of kidnappers, which led to the development of his ideology at a young age. 
        When the Titans invade Shiganshina, Eren is powerless as he watches his mother be devoured by an abnormally large titan with a face deformity that gives it a constant smile, and thus vows to kill every Titan henceforth. 
        Eren then enlists himself in the military, with hazy memories of last meeting his father while receiving a key to their home's basement. 
        During his first mission at Trost, Eren sacrifices himself to save his friend Armin Arlert from being swallowed by a bearded Titan. 
        Eren manages to transform into a Titan himself, proving his newfound strength worthy to fight for mankind. 
        Eren earns a place in the Special Operations Squad, a branch of Survey Corps under Captain Levi. 
        Eren is hunted by a female Titan but is saved by Levi and Mikasa. 
        The Titan is later revealed to be his classmate Annie Leonhart, who is defeated by Eren but freezes herself. 
        Upon being chased by more of Annie's allies, Eren awakens a power known as the "Founding Titan" (始祖の巨人, Shiso no Kyojin), which he subconsciously uses to direct a group of Titans to attack them. 
        The Smiling Titan reappears and attempts to kill Eren and Mikasa, but Eren uses his power to command another herd of Titans to beat it to death.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
        Soon after, Eren is sent with his friends to an isolated village while preparations are made for a campaign to retake Wall Maria. Eren is then captured by Rod Reiss, who reveals 
        the Founding Titan was originally in his family for years since their ancestor Karl Fritz created the walls, and that the Reiss family used it to rule until it was stolen by Grisha. 
        Grisha is revealed to be responsible for Eren becoming a Titan, passing the Founding Titan’s power to his son at the cost of his life. 
        Eren's classmate Krista Lenz, who is actually Rod's child Historia Reiss, refuses to aid her father and frees Eren. 
        Eren and the Survey Corps led by Commander Erwin depart to Shiganshina to reclaim Wall Maria and battle an army of Titans led by Zeke, the Beast Titan, and his subordinates Bertholdt 
        and Reiner, who are also Eren's former classmates and the real identity of the Colossal Titan and Armored Titan. 
        Erwin sacrifices himself in a suicide charge to distract Zeke whilst Levi sneaks up behind him. 
        Zeke kills Erwin and most of the Corps by throwing a volley of boulders at them, with Erwin being nearly sliced in half. 
        Levi fights Zeke after this, slicing open his left arm, slashing his heels open and slicing his eyes out. 
        He then attempts to subdue Zeke, now in his human form, but he escapes. 
        Armin devises a plan to kill Bertholdt and charges his head on, but Bertholdt uses the collosal's power to burn Armin to a crisp and almost kill him, but Eren rips him out of his Titan and defeats him. 
        Mikasa fires a missile down the Armored Titan's mouth and thus renders Reiner also immobilised. 
        Levi uses a serum to turn Armin into a Titan, so that he can both be healed and possess the power of the Collosal Titan when he eats Bertholdt. 
        He does so, and Bertholdt begs for forgiveness and mercy from the same people he tried to kill before Armin crushes his skull and devours him.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
        With Shiganshina secured,[31] Eren and his friends learn of Grisha's past once they reach the Yeager family basement: Zeke is revealed to be Eren's half 
        brother and Grisha's first son, and the people within the walls are revealed to have originated in another nation named Marley. 
        They learn that humanity exists beyond the walls and that their true enemy is Marley, while they live on an island called Paradis Island, and are a race called 
        Eldians (specifically the "Subjects of Ymir"), descendants of the original titan shifter Ymir Fritz. 
        They learn that in the past, Ymir Fritz’s power split into the Nine Titans that would be passed down to her people. 
        This power was used to conquer and subjugate many races and nations, including Marley. 
        Marley eventually overthrew Eldia, taking control of Seven of the Nine Titans before oppressing and demeaning the Eldians left on the continental mainland, using them as 
        holders of the Titan powers as a means to conquer and subjugate other nations, just as the Eldian Empire had once done. 
        Eren learns that he has a limited lifespan as a side effect of being a holder of two of the Nine Titans' power, including the 
        titular "Attack Titan" (進撃の巨人, Shingeki no Kyojin), along with the Founding Titan, only having 8 years left to live.
