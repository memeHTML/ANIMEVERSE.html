    <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
    <p id="intro">
        Itachi is a member of the Uchiha Clan from the village of Konohagakure and the elder brother of Sasuke Uchiha. He grew up as the child prodigy of the Uchiha clan, 
        establishing milestones for not only Sasuke, but also for future Uchiha to live up to. 
        His early childhood was marred by war, the violence of which caused him to seek peace at any cost. 
        Upon learning that his clan was planning a coup d'état to take control of Konoha, after his clan was accused of attacking the village with the Nine-Tails, 
        Itachi provides Konoha with intelligence on his clan's actions during his two years as a member of the ANBU. 
        Over time, Itachi distances himself from his clan, as some clan members believed he murdered his best friend, Shisui Uchiha, to gain the Mangekyo Sharingan
    </p>

    <p class="para">
        In reality, as Shisui possesses the ability to subliminally manipulate others and shares Itachi's love for the village, he intended to use his gift on the Uchiha clan leader to stop the coup d'état. However, 
        Shisui is mortally wounded by the Leaf High Council member Danzo Shimura, who then takes his eye to achieve his own ideal of peace. 
        When Shisui entrusts Itachi with his remaining eye, Itachi covers up Shisui's death to make it appear it was his doing. Eventually, in return for Danzo's offer to spare his younger brother, Itachi slaughters his entire clan. 
        After creating the misconception that he murdered their family in cold blood to give Sasuke the mindset to become strong enough to kill him once he is capable, Itachi leaves the village, although he warns Danzo not to harm Sasuke. 
        Meeting up with Konoha's Third Hokage Hiruzen Sarutobi, who promises to do what he can to look after Sasuke, Itachi reveals his intentions to continue to protect the village from the shadows. 
        Soon after perceiving them as a threat to Konoha, Itachi joins the Akatsuki to ensure they do not endanger his village. 
        Itachi becomes good friends with his partner Kisame Hoshigaki, who expresses concern for Itachi's wellbeing.

    <p class="para">
        Itachi has ranked high in the Weekly Shonen Jump popularity polls for the series, continuously placing in the top 10. He was ranked in fifth position in the polls of 2011. 
        In the 2023 online global poll, held to celebrate the 20 years of the manga, 
        Itachi was found to be the second most popular character in the franchise, behind only Minato Namikaze. 
        The character received generally positive reviews from several publications for manga, anime, video games, and other related media. 
        IGN reader Jason Van Horn characterized Itachi as "badass" and jokingly mentioned that he is a character to be afraid of since, in his first fight in the series, he does not make any remarkable move. 
        He found that "there is just something about the cold and numb Itachi," that makes the viewer "want to breakout in chills". 
        IGN's Charles White liked the episode where the relationship between young Sasuke and Itachi is revealed, and hoped to see more of their past to resolve the mystery of Itachi's character commenting that learning about their "past has been intriguing". 
        NTT customers voted him as their tenth favorite black haired male anime character. 
        CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama referred to Itachi as one of his favorite characters from Naruto.
