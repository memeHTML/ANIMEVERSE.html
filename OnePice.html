    <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
    <p id="intro">
        As one of the Four Emperors, and at the young age of 19, Luffy is one of the four most powerful pirates in the world. He captains the Straw Hat Pirates, 
        holding the greatest authority over a mighty and diverse crew consisting of several infamous members, many of whom are extremely powerful in their own right.
        Luffy has a tremendous amount of influence over his crewmates, so much so that they all trust him with their lives,
        despite his reckless behavior and, in some cases, even because of it.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
        He is also one of twelve pirates who have been dubbed as the "Worst Generation", 
        a group of individuals who have become infamous for the bold and major actions they have committed against the World Government, 
        and all have bounties of over Beli100,000,000. Indirectly, he also has claim over the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, 
        a massive fleet consisting of seven powerful New World crews numbering 5640 people in total, 
        who all swore to serve under him of their own will and come to assist him whenever he may need them. 
        The scope of Luffy's authority was considered by the World Government to be close to on par with the Four Emperors, 
        the four most powerful and influential pirates in the world, and the press dubbed Luffy the "Fifth Emperor" as a result.

    <p class="para">
        However, Luffy officially became an Emperor after defeating one of the previous Emperors, Kaidou, and his meteoric rise in status 
        (in over two years) caused panic around the world; he currently holds a bounty of Beli3,000,000,000, 
        which is currently the lowest Emperor bounty and equals the bounties of two of his fellow Worst Generation membersâ€”Kid and Law. 
        His bounty is only surpassed by the bounties of the former Emperors Whitebeard, Big Mom, Kaidou, fellow Emperors Shanks, 
        Blackbeard and Buggy, former Warlord Mihawk and the late Pirate King, Gol D. Roger himself.
