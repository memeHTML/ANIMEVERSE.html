    <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
    <p id="intro">
        Edward Elric (Japanese: エドワード・エルリック, Hepburn: Edowādo Erurikku) is a fictional character and the titular protagonist of the Fullmetal Alchemist manga series created by Hiromu Arakawa.
         Edward, titled the Fullmetal Alchemist (鋼の錬金術師, Hagane no Renkinjutsushi, lit. Alchemist of Steel), is the youngest State Alchemist in the history of the fictional country of Amestris.
         His left leg was divinely severed in a failed attempt to resurrect his dead mother, and then his right arm was taken in exchange for his brother's soul.
         His missing limbs have been replaced with sophisticated prosthetics called automail (機械鎧オートメイル, ōtomeiru).
         He and his younger brother, Alphonse, who lost his entire body and is spiritually bound to a suit of armor, scour the world in search of the Philosopher's Stone in the hopes of restoring their bodies.
         Edward has appeared in other media from the series, including video games, original video animations (OVAs) and light novels.

         Numerous publications in various media have been written on the subject of Edward's character. Reviewers praised Edward as a balance between the typical clever kid and the stubborn kid persona. 
         Additionally, his comedic moments have been celebrated as some of the best moments in the series.
          His Japanese and English voice actors, Romi Park and Vic Mignogna, have both been praised for their performances as Edward and have won several awards for their work.
         Numerous pieces of merchandise have been released bearing Edward's likeness, including key chains and action figures.

        Author Hiromu Arakawa integrated several social problems into the plot, such as the way Edward and Alphonse live as brothers after the death of their mother, Trisha.
        She also looks at how the brothers help people all over the country to gain an understanding of the meaning of family. 
        When describing the character's personality, Arakawa comments that after his father's departure from home and his mother's death, Edward tried to replace the role of the man for the Elric family. 
        As a result, Van Hohenheim's reappearance caused a shocking and terrified reaction in the character. 
        Arakawa has noted that Edward is one of her favorite characters from the series, although she denied having the same personality as him when one of her assistants mentioned it.

        In the Japanese version of Fullmetal Alchemist's anime adaptations, Edward has been voiced by Romi Park. In the English version, the role has been played by Vic Mignogna. 
        Mignogna has stated that performing Edward may be his biggest voice acting achievement since fans do not compare him with Park, noting that their voices are not similar and that he did not plan to sound like her.

    <p class="para">
        In a prototype from the series, Edward was an eighteen-year-old teenager travelling alongside his father whose soul sealed in a flying squirrel. Edward's prototype had an average height, but retained his automail. 
        In order to fit with the readers from the manga magazine Monthly Shonen Gangan, Edward's traits were further modified, leaving his current one. His height was reduced in order to contrast with Alphonse's huge armor.
         In the design of the character, Arakawa is often worried about not making his automail too bulky to avoid balancing it by increasing Edward's muscles, making his appearance unsuitable for his age. 
         She has also often drawn the character in full body length, but at one point noticed she made it too tall. 
         As the manga continued serialization, Arakawa found that she drew Edward half naked several times even more than Alex Louis Armstrong who tends to show his torso.
         While stating that this was because she wanted to draw Edward's automail, she commented that it was common for men to walk in underwear at their homes.
