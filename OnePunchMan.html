    <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
    <p id="intro">
        Saitama (サイタマ, Saitama) is the main protagonist of the series and the titular One-Punch Man. He is currently the most powerful being to exist in the series. 
        Saitama faces a self-imposed existential crisis, as he is now too powerful to gain any thrill from battle.
        Initially just a hero for fun, Saitama later registers to be a professional hero for the Hero Association upon realizing that nobody recognizes him as a hero, 
        and defends his home in Z-City from monsters, villains, and other threats. Under the Hero Association, he is assigned the hero name Caped Baldy (ハゲマント, Hagemanto; Viz: Bald Cape) and is currently A-Class Rank 39.
        Saitama is an ordinary-looking bald man with brown eyes, a thin but well-built physique, and is of average height and weight. He used to have a full head of short black hair but lost it due to the intensity of his hero training regimen.
        Saitama is usually deliberately drawn in a more simplistic style than the other characters, similar to the style of the original webcomic, 
        with an elliptical head and simple facial features. When drawn in a more serious style, Saitama is revealed to have sharp facial features, fearsome eyes, and chiseled musculature. 
        His posture changes as well, with a slack posture and sloping shoulders when lax, and a straightened posture and squared shoulders when serious.
        Saitama's character on the upper surface can be best summed up as "average". At first glance, nothing about him strikes anyone he meets or causes them to note anything remarkable about him. 
        Before becoming a hero, he was an average salaryman and did not seem interested in anything initially, though becoming a hero has always been a dream of Saitama's. 
        Before becoming one, he used to be frustrated about society, just like Hammerhead and even commenting that he could have become just like them depending on the path he took.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
        Due to his great power and being virtually indestructible, Saitama is an indifferent person. Even the mightiest foes pose no challenge to him, 
        so he does not take his hero work seriously, goes through everything with little to no effort, and yearns for an opponent that can provide him with a challenge. 
        The lack of worthy opponents has led him to suffer from a self-imposed existential crisis, and he claims that his ability to feel any emotions has dulled considerably. 
        The combination of his attitude, unstoppable power, and "unimpressive" appearance often causes his battles to become anticlimactic. 
        Saitama will usually allow his opponents to rant about their motives and power up into their strongest forms, before obliterating them with a single punch.
        Saitama's indifference doesn't rest solely on his hero work either. In daily life, he is often seen lounging around, playing video games, reading manga, or 
        going out for strolls. His taste in food is rather plain, and he often frequents food stalls rather than going to restaurants or cooking at home. 
        As his primary interest, hero work has become unfulfilling, and he pays little attention to anything else. A running gag about Saitama is his inability to remember people's faces and names, 
        as seen when he forgot Speed-o'-Sound Sonic's name, or when he could not remember who Tanktop Tiger was. Because of this, he sometimes ends up pronouncing people's names incorrectly, 
        much to their chagrin. Saitama does not care if people insult him, and he usually ignores them and says that they need a hobby; the only insult that could get a reaction out of him is anything about his lack of hair. 
        He has expressed distaste towards his officially assigned hero name, Caped Baldy. Thus, even after receiving it, he always refers to himself as Saitama.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
        Despite his indifference, Saitama can find things that interest him and actively looks for activities to relieve his boredom. 
        These things tend to be mundane activities such as watching TV, shopping, or playing games. He shows a measure of concern when it comes to bargains and deals, 
        as seen when he fought Carnage Kabuto, where he was more shocked upon the realization that he was going to miss a bargain sale, rather than his opponent, who had undergone a transformation and was beating him around.
        He can also express irritation and even outright anger depending on the situation. However, Saitama has limited patience for long explanations and often interrupts the speaker. 
        His ideal word count is 20 or less.[38] He can get angry when he loses to someone like King when they play games. 
        He will become enraged if anyone messes with his food or damages his house as he immediately killed a mantis monster 
        for crashing through his roof and told Genos to move his fight with Sonic somewhere away from his apartment.
        Aside from being quite a cheapskate due to his financial status, he has a greedy side seen when he tried to steal bags of gold from the underground mine
         inside the Monster Association Headquarters and was visibly upset after accidentally dropping them down to the bottom of an underground ravine.
        Despite his general indifference to most things, Saitama was genuinely shocked when he realized that no one knew of him despite his achievements, 
        curious as to why he doesn't have any fans. This reaction demonstrates that while he isn't necessarily into hero work for fame, he certainly doesn't object to it. 
        Another running joke is Saitama's jealousy of higher rankings, such as when he grew irritated when Genos listed off all of the comments made by fans about how amazing Genos is in their eyes.
