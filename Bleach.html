    <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
    <p id="intro">
        Ichigo's most distinguishing feature is his spiky orange hair, a trait he has been ridiculed about for years on end. 
        He is a fairly tall, lean-built young man with peach skin and brown eyes. He likes to wear slim fitting clothes. 
        He has a tendency to wear shirts patterned with the number 15 because his name is a homonym for the number. 
        Since becoming a Shinigami, he has become noticeably more muscular, as noted by his sister Karin. 
        When in his spiritual form, Ichigo wears the standard Shinigami shihakushō, with the addition of a strap across his chest. 
        Initially, it was a thick brown belt to hold his Zanpakutō sheath, but it later became a red rosary-like strap after awakening his own Shinigami powers. 
        It is shaped like a kite with a flat top and bottom. Ichigo's appearance has caused several people, including Jūshirō Ukitake, to note a similarity to Kaien Shiba, 
        the former lieutenant of the 13th Division. After training in the Dangai, Ichigo's hair grows considerably, and he is noticeably taller, as stated by his friends. 
        After Ichigo loses his Shinigami powers, his appearance reverts to the way it was before his Dangai training.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
        When he was younger, Ichigo considered his mother to be the center of his world, always smiling when he was with Masaki and regularly holding her hand. 
        Despite crying whenever he lost in a match at the dojo he attended, Ichigo started to smile again as soon as he saw 
        Masaki when she came to pick him up. At a very young age, Ichigo heard his father saying his name means "to protect one thing," which instilled in him a 
        desire to protect his mother. When his sisters were born, he began attending a dojo for the sake of protecting them. Since then, 
        the number of people he wishes to protect has continued to grow, causing Ichigo to risk his life to protect both the people close to him and complete strangers.

        As a teenager, Ichigo is stubborn, short-tempered, strong-willed, and impulsive.[26][27] Despite claiming not to care about what other people think about him, he attempts to 
        maintain a detached and "cool" image. He generally keeps his face set in a near-permanent scowl, with his eyebrows drawn together. His outspoken, 
        hot-headed demeanor is a trait Ichigo himself has acknowledged, and if somebody picks a fight with him, he cannot help fighting back. He coldly refers to his teachers as "instructors". 
        He is genuinely compassionate and empathetic towards others, promising to bring a Plus flowers and a toy plane, or soothing others when they become upset.
        
        Ichigo is a capable student, ranked 23rd in his year at school, who studies regularly and does not neglect his schoolwork. 
        He works as hard as he does to overcome the misconceptions many have about him based on his hair color and fighting. Ichigo hates fortune telling, horoscopes, feng shui, psychics, 
        and anyone whose trade involves taking money from people for things they cannot see. He has difficulty remembering people's faces and names. However, 
        Ichigo can remember the names of noticeable individuals even when they did not directly tell him their names. Ichigo becomes extremely shy and uncomfortable around nude or immodestly dressed women, 
        a fact both Yoruichi Shihōin and Rangiku Matsumoto have teased him for. Ichigo is often disrespectful when talking to those older than himself, 
        calling Genryūsai Shigekuni Yamamoto "gramps" and referring to several of the Shinigami captains by their given names without using honorifics.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
        When it comes to fighting, Ichigo has a complex sense of honor; he regularly seeks to exact revenge for the cruel actions of his opponent, such as instilling the fear 
        of being murdered in Shrieker and cutting off the right arm of Yammy Llargo in retaliation for him ripping Yasutora Sado's right arm off.
        He often taunts and belittles his opponents when fighting, sometimes attacking without warning. Ichigo has a strong desire to win his fights, but in what he views as a legitimate manner. 
        To this end, he has often refused the aid of his inner Hollow, even when knowing it would allow him to win. Ichigo's resolve in battle can waver at times, 
        which can impede his fighting prowess, and goes into a state of depression and self-loathing when he loses a major battle or lets a friend down.
        Ichigo despises those who mistreat their allies in any way, even if they are his own enemies. He was disgusted when Yammy calls Ulquiorra Cifer, Nnoitra Gilga, and Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez "trash".
