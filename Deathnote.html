    <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
    <p id="intro">
        In Tokyo, a disaffected high school student named Light Yagami finds the "Death Note", a mysterious black notebook that can end anyone’s 
        life as long as the writer knows both the target's true name and face. Initially disbelieving, 
        Light quickly considers the renewed possibilities of such an ability at his disposal and annihilates high-profile Japanese criminals then targets international criminals. 
        Five days after discovering the notebook, Light is visited by Ryuk, a "shinigami" and the Death Note's previous owner. Ryuk,
        invisible to anyone who has not touched the notebook, reveals that he dropped the notebook into the human world out of boredom and is amused by Light's actions.

    <p class="para">
        As criminals around the world die from inexplicable accidents and heart attacks, the global media suggest that a single mastermind is responsible for the mysterious murders and name 
        them "Kira" (キラ, the Japanese transliteration of the word "killer"). Hoping to apprehend Kira, 
        Interpol requests the assistance of an enigmatic consulting detective, known as L, to assist in their investigation. Deducing that Kira is based in Japan, 
        L tricks Light into revealing that he is in the Kanto region of Japan by manipulating him to kill a decoy. Furious, Light vows to kill L, whom he views as obstructing his plans. 
        L deduces that Kira has inside knowledge of the Japanese police investigation, being led by Light's father, Soichiro Yagami. 
        Under the suspicion that "Kira" could have family ties with members of the "Kira" investigation, L assigns a team of FBI agents to monitor the families of those 
        connected with the investigation and L learns enough to designate Light as the prime suspect. Around this time, Light graduates from high school to college. 
        L recruits Light into the Kira Task Force, with each trying to get the other to reveal crucial information.

    <p class="para">
        Actress-model Misa Amane, having obtained a second Death Note from a shinigami named Rem, makes a deal with Rem for shinigami eyes, which reveal the names of anyone whose face she sees, 
        at the cost of half her lifespan. Seeking to have Light become her boyfriend, Misa uncovers Light's identity as the original Kira, 
        but Light has another motive: he intends to use Misa's shinigami eyes to discern L's true name. L deduces that Misa is likely the second Kira and detains her. 
        Rem threatens to kill Light if he does not find a way to save Misa. Light arranges a scheme in which he and Misa temporarily lose their memories of the Death Note, 
        and has Rem pass the Death Note to a less morally driven individual, Kyosuke Higuchi of the Yotsuba Group
