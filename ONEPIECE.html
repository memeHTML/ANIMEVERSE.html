    <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
    <p id="intro">
        Monkey D. Luffy, also known as "Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as "Straw Hat",[10] is the founder and captain of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well as the most powerful of its top fighters. 
        He desires to find the legendary treasure left behind by the late Gol D. Roger and thereby become the Pirate King,[28] which would help facilitate an unknown dream of his that he has told only to Shanks, his brothers, and crew. 
        He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.

        Born in Foosha Village, Luffy is the son of Monkey D. Dragon, the leader of the Revolutionary Army, and the grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp, where their family carries the initial 
        of D. At age 7, Luffy accidentally ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi, which turned his body into rubber. Shanks also gave Luffy the very straw hat that has become Luffy's signature accessory, 
        having gifted it to the boy as part of a promise for them to meet again someday after he became a great pirate. 
        Growing up on Dawn Island under the care of Curly Dadan, Luffy befriended and became sworn brothers of the late "Fire Fist" Portgas D. Ace and Revolutionary Chief-of-Staff Sabo.
        
        Luffy has gone up against numerous global powers around him, starting with fighting the most powerful pirates in the East Blue and moving to clashes against the Marines, 
        Seven Warlords of the Sea, Cipher Pol, World Nobles, and even the Four Emperors of the Grand Line, emerging victorious in a majority of these battles. 
        He invaded and indirectly caused the annihilation of Enies Lobby, escaped the impregnable Impel Down, and was a focal figure in the Summit War of Marineford. 
        He has also either defeated or befriended seven of the eleven known past or present Warlords prior to the organization's dissolution. Furthermore, 
        Luffy has invaded the territory of the Four Emperors on multiple occasions and eventually managed to defeat one. 
        Luffy's accomplishments and heritage have caused him to be labeled as a "Dangerous Future Element" while in the process gaining a reputation for being "reckless" and, in some cases, "insane," 
        earning the wrath of Fleet Admiral Sakazuki, the Marine Headquarters, and even the World Government.

    <p class="para">
        Luffy also has a penchant for attracting followers and has unwillingly been named the leader of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, consisting of seven pirate crews who swore to come to his aid whenever he wishes. After learning of this and his exploits against the Big Mom Pirates, 
        the press labeled him the "Fifth Emperor of the Sea," though many prominent figures initially considered this to be exaggerated. 
        However, after defeating Kaidou during the Raid on Onigashima, Luffy was officially declared as one of the Four Emperors by the World Government along with Buggy, replacing Kaidou and Big Mom.

        Luffy has made tremendous strides in his life of piracy, with his bounty heavily reflecting this fact. He gained his first bounty of Beli30,000,000 for defeating the strongest pirate captains of the East Blue, which then increased to Beli100,000,000 after defeating Crocodile in Arabasta. 
        After his crew's invasion into and escape from Enies Lobby, his bounty was increased to Beli300,000,000. His sizeable bounty upon arriving at the Sabaody Archipelago caused Luffy, 
        along with Zoro to be included among the eleven "Super Rookies", pirates who simultaneously reached the Red Line with bounties of over Beli100,000,000 shortly before the Summit War. 
        He, the other ten Super Rookies, and Marshall D. Teach would go on to be referred to as the "Worst Generation".
        
        Two years after the war, with his bounty increased to Beli400,000,000, he entered the New World and began challenging the Emperors and their allies directly, with his bounty going up to Beli500,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc, and later all the way to Beli1,500,000,000 
        after the global revelation that he is Sabo's brother and the existence of Straw Hat Grand Fleet becoming public, as well as the events of the Whole Cake Island Arc. 
        After leading the Raid on Onigashima and defeating Kaidou, his bounty was increased to Beli3,000,000,000, placing him as one of the members of the Four Emperors.

        Luffy is a young man of average height with shaggy black hair, round black eyes, and a slim muscular build. He is renowned for his trademark straw hat (from which he gets his nickname "Straw Hat Luffy"), which was lent to him when he was young by the legendary pirate captain, 
        "Red-Haired" Shanks, who in turn received it from Gol D. Roger.[43] He wears blue shorts with cuffs, sandals, and a sleeveless red vest. 
        Luffy also has a scar with two stitches underneath his left eye, which he earned as a child by stabbing his face to show Shanks that he was tough enough to be a pirate. 
        He was severely wounded by Akainu in the Summit War of Marineford, leaving a large X-shaped scar on his chest.
